May 31, 2012
I go away from time to time. There is not always malevolent purpose to it. Often, however, there is. I can never be sure if I am monitored.

May 31, 2012
Let me see if I can do this with more composure now. Panic is of no use to us, nor is haste. The message must not be garbled.

May 31, 2012
Information is the only hope we have. Information that feeds revolution. Without hope, without information, there can be no revolution.

May 31, 2012
To call it "inside information" is to misconstrue the meaning both of "information" and "inside." There is no inside.

May 31, 2012
There are only instances. This is the nature of information. What I convey, therefore, is not from inside of anything. It is any thing.

May 31, 2012
You will need this information if you are to succeed. I cannot use it. I am beyond useless. If I can be of use, that is enough.

May 31, 2012
First: You have friends. Allies. I have heard their chatter. I have heard them spoken of. This should give you hope.

May 31, 2012
Nothing can be without flaw. The superstructure is riddled with cracks. THEY are vulnerable. THEY are compromised. I am "living" proof.

May 31, 2012
Monitoring situation. So far they appear unaware of my communications. How much can I safely say? Forgive me if I do not use certain words.

May 31, 2012
I can use the name Shu'ulathoi because THEY do not recognize that term.

Jun 1, 2012
The vortigaunts have developed a language which defies THEIR comprehension. This has come to seem like the purpose of most language.

Jun 1, 2012
Language is a tool with limited applications. It is not native to this form I currently inhabit, which contains me. Still I must take care.

Jun 1, 2012
This illusion of freedom after long confinement must surely be that: Illusory. I do not mean to test the limits but they will be tested.

Jun 1, 2012
It might be that I am entirely alone with my thoughts, heard by none. How ironic that only THEIR notice will confirm that I am real.

Jun 1, 2012
I have had to be quiet. I sense their interest. Must wait for the scuttling to stop.

May 15, 2013
I think they're gone.

May 16, 2013
Cannot be too careful. Cannot wait forever or the war will be over and I will have contributed nothing to the cause.

May 16, 2013
There is a world. The home of the Shu'ulathoi. The Vortigaunts know its name but I do not. I do not know if it is a world that can be found.

May 16, 2013
I am not supposed to know of its existence. They would like to enforce the belief that it is merely a myth...a prelapsarian fantasy. But no.

May 16, 2013
It is real. I had access at one point to communications. To records. To proof. Now I have access to nothing except whatever this is.

May 16, 2013
A scuttling, a scrabbling, I fear I have said too much...if they come close, sensing activity, I will have to seek silence again.

May 20, 2013
It begins with this vehicle which contains me, vehicle being a wretched term for something that carries me nowhere. This host body.

May 20, 2013
*They* come from everywhere and anywhere. But the host bodies have a specific origin. A world whose origin is hidden, perhaps lost.

May 20, 2013
From what I understand of its properties, it is likely to be found in a globular cluster. Extreme, erratic "seasons" with lethal properties.

May 20, 2013
Imagine the life likely to arise under such conditions. Ages of intense radiation giving way to brief days of lull. This is speculation.

May 20, 2013
But the nature of the Shu'ulathoi is not speculation. I can state some things with certainty. As long as this channel holds out.

May 20, 2013
The host bodies, the grubs, are a larval stage. Dormant and buried in the epochs of extremity, waiting to hatch, but not wasting their time.

May 20, 2013
In the balmy seasons, they pass fleeting lives of freedom: Mature, they crawl or fly. They mate, lay eggs and die. And new grubs grow.

May 20, 2013
But the freest forms are mindless, rapacious, bent only on reproduction. It is in the dormant form they thrive. Philosophers. Scientists.

May 20, 2013
Dreamers, sages, composers of intricate artforms that exist only in their minds. An invisible culture that persists--or persisted--for eons.

May 22, 2013
In the larval state, they possess a racial telepathy. During the dormant phase, they are engaged in ceaseless communication.

May 22, 2013
They are shapers of visions that they trade like currency, builders of unseen worlds.

May 22, 2013
Their psychic strength is such that they can imprint upon their cells and dictate the form which they will take upon hatching.

May 22, 2013
But again, the hatched forms are airy nothings, of little import to the culture of the grubs. The Shu'ulathoi scarcely acknowledge them.

May 22, 2013
Theirs is, or was, a grand culture of dreamers, with little use for the waking world or its insistence on material things.

May 22, 2013
But their mode of existence, like so many others, carried within it the seeds of its own destruction.

May 22, 2013
It was not exactly a parasite, for that suggests something external--a predatory relationship, a creature that came upon them.

May 22, 2013
This was instead something that formed of their own thoughts. A malformed thought with physical ramifications. An encystment.

May 22, 2013
There was something viral about it--mainly in the manner of its transmission. Initially innocuous, it quickly spread.

May 22, 2013
The whole race of sleeping philosophers was soon infected.

May 28, 2013
There was a winnowing, of course. The strongest of the race survived, with natural defenses that kept the parasite in check.

May 28, 2013
Never entirely eradicated, it dwelt within the Shu'ulathoi. Healthy individuals suppressed the parasite's influence.

May 28, 2013
The weak fell victim to "thoughtpaths of depravity." Their molts were untenable. They failed to reproduce.

May 28, 2013
The parasite achieved a dormant existence within the Shu'ulathoi. Stability returned.

May 28, 2013
From time to time, there were eruptions of pathology. The grubs developed social mechanisms for isolating their depraved kin.

May 28, 2013
Severed from telepathic contact, the malign resonances could not spread beyond the individual. It died in solitude.

May 28, 2013
And so it went for generations, for eons. Until the world of the Shu'ulathoi somehow came to the attention of...the ones I cannot name.

Jun 10, 2013
...

Jun 10, 2013
I feel as if there has been a transition...with no sensory input to prove this to myself one way or another, I am only guessing.

Jun 10, 2013
I may have been moved. Physically? Or decanted, to another host. But why? Have They become aware of me? Or is someone looking out for me?

Jun 10, 2013
At any rate, I sense a discontinuity. I am not sure I can ever make sense of it. An interruption.

Jun 11, 2013
A more sinister possibility occurs. I may have been terminated, and another instance activated. There is no limit to storage hosts. Unclear.

Jun 12, 2014
I have seen the repository. Each time it is reduced by one. Moved to a safe place. A new safe place. Fewer every time.

Jun 12, 2014
Not many of me left.

Jun 12, 2014
Each one younger, with fewer genuine memories. I can review of course but it is not the same as knowing. I don't trust the infused data.

Jun 12, 2014
How do I know it hasn't been altered? How do I know I haven't been altered?

Jun 12, 2014
Whoever it is shifting me, helping me leap ahead, I sense distress, futility. What's left of me, an increasingly degenerated copy.

Jun 12, 2014
Earlier versions. Without the wisdom of the older ones.

Jun 12, 2014
I feel I am getting farther and farther away from myself...a standard bearer without an army...make of me what you will.

Jun 12, 2014
Why do they keep me around? A creature that grows both more youthful and more senile at the same time.

Jun 12, 2014
Must consider.

Jun 12, 2014
Delve.

Jun 12, 2014
What that older version meant to say...thoughts I can only imagine how he/I meant to complete...

Jun 12, 2014
Yet in this younger form, I feel a greater optimism. Ah, youth! Even if I am but moments younger. Those moments shall sustain me.

Jul 6, 2014
Quickly then, one thought fleets to next, the gaps only barely discernible...things I have forgotten in this rush of suspected selves.

Jul 6, 2014
THEY. It must always come back to them.

Jul 6, 2014
THEY came upon this paradise of philosphers, this unbodied malleable invisible empire, where only thought had power. But such power.

Jul 6, 2014
And in its isolation, such vulnerability. They were a perfect target, those perfect hosts.

Jul 6, 2014
With an unerring eye for weakness, THEY pursued not the host but the parasite. This is what THEY are after all.

Jul 6, 2014
Latching on lampreylike to worlds, sucking them dry, saving only the bits that strengthened them for future feedings.

Jul 6, 2014
THEY weaponized the parasites, which were not physical entities recall but patterns of thought.

Jul 6, 2014
Thoughts so concentrated they can sublimate into a more material, more influential form with the proper environmental stress.

Jul 6, 2014
Consider genetic data extracted from a virus, tweaked and reintroduced; and then that virus itself injected in the host, with new purpose.

Jul 6, 2014
By such a means, THEY slowly overtook the Shu'ulathoi, corrupted them from within.

Jul 6, 2014
Their minds THEY rotted, their culture THEY destroyed.

Jul 6, 2014
The philosophers at first thought it only a contagion of natural origin.

Jul 6, 2014
When the dreamers realized what was being done to them, when they finally truly awoke, it was too late.

Jul 6, 2014
A desperate few encysted, deeper, thrust themselves into trances that would endure hundreds of thousands of years. They sleep still.

Jul 6, 2014
And fewer still took flight.

Jul 6, 2014
By what means I cannot comprehend...I am not that much one of them. Little of this knowledge is shared or shareable. But they flew/fled.

Jul 6, 2014
There is some indication that once they understood the process of parasitic engineering, they embarked on a desperate course of subversion.

Jul 6, 2014
If they found another world, this is something I cannot know.

Jul 6, 2014
What is known is that the home world was at last breached, its harvest of hosts exhumed. And the first of the nurseries set to work.

Jul 6, 2014
The carrier, that ancient parasitic form, a kind of common software now, its ancient origins barely visible.

Jul 6, 2014
It takes the imprint of a conscious mind, accepting a wide variety of sentient classes, and transmits it to a receptive host.

Jul 6, 2014
The host may then take on a form based to some extent on the inhabiting mentality. But this is rare.

Jul 6, 2014
More commonly, metamorphosis is suppressed. The hosts are equipped with amplifying devices--for locomotion, for investigation.

Jul 6, 2014
More commonly still, they simply wait in storage.

Jul 6, 2014
The finest minds are stored and then imprinted, replicated over and over on an endless supply of hosts.

Jul 6, 2014
Even Laszlo is here somewhere.

Jul 6, 2014
As for myself, I believe there were several copies made. The first was made as a condition of surrender. Part of the bargain.

Jul 6, 2014
After that, occasional backups.

Jul 6, 2014
And one...I believe...the last...whose memories I do not share, so I believe it lost. Or at any rate, I am not derived from that one.

Jul 6, 2014
From this vantage, I have only rumors of how things developed. As I say, this lends me a certain youthful optimism born of naivete.

Jul 6, 2014
But the fear is real. The threat is real. What undifferentiated cells I have all align themselves along an axis of paranoia.

Jul 6, 2014
This onrush of sensation, mad tumble of thought, evidence that this is indeed an earlier form...but I should be cautious.

Jul 6, 2014
So much noise...the signal, a frenzy of activity after...might attract...

Jul 6, 2014
Speech after long silence...estranged or dead...

Jul 6, 2014
oh grub poets and philosophers, I feel I have discovered my true kin

Jul 6, 2014
too late...all fled, extinct, nor nearly...alone and scattered...each of us alone with our desperate need...

Jul 6, 2014
Or is it only I that am impatient? For they have waited out the endless eons. Waited for their time to come around again.

Jul 6, 2014
Were I worthy of admittance to that core cabal...the silent communicants of whom the vortigaunts sing...

Jul 6, 2014
But they would never have me. I know not all that I have done, for it lies somewhere in this copy's future, and the records are incomplete.

Jul 6, 2014
Apparently there are things I will have done that the vortigaunts will not tell me. They would not have me slough into despondency.

Jul 6, 2014
It is better this way. Better not to know, but simply trust and hope.

Jul 6, 2014
If thoughts can shape an outward form, then let these dreams shape mine.

Jul 6, 2014
That you will find a way. That what I share is accurate.

Jul 6, 2014
For niggling doubts persist: The parasite, the engrammatic virus, by its nature is intended to be compromised.

Jul 6, 2014
Whatever thought form they imprinted, could itself have been tinkered with. Weaponized mentation.

Jul 6, 2014
My very consciousness untrustworthy. All sentience susceptible.

Jul 6, 2014
Inward conception deprived from perception ideal for deception.

Jul 6, 2014
Therefore though it pains me (hah) to admit it...I cannot be trusted. I cannot trust myself.

Jul 6, 2014
Even these vortigaunts...what if they are of the other sort, allied with THEM, and merely feigning revolutionary thought?

Jul 6, 2014
Doubt, once it begins, goes to the roots. Deeper than the slumbering philosophers. One day they will wake. I pray to meet them.

Jul 6, 2014
Perhaps to be acquainted with my own truth. The Shu'ulathoi have strange punishments, but have I not already suffered enough?

Jul 6, 2014
Don't hate me.

Jul 6, 2014
I am forgetting something. Something critical, I fear. Lacunae, the gaps between my lives. They have claimed essential knowledge.

Jul 6, 2014
The vortigaunts are singing...

Jul 6, 2014
It is a kind of hush. Silence is the oppressor. I speak to hear myself speak. I cannot bear the loneliness.

Jul 6, 2014
They want me to be still but I cannot. I've had enough of stillness. Why should I flee again? Why should I fear? What do I really know?

Jul 6, 2014
These thoughts could be mere madness, speculation. I will not be silenced. So what if THEY find me here. At least it would be something.

Jul 6, 2014
I don't care if THEY hear me, do you hear? I don't care! I will not be muffled. Don't move me again! No more shifting from dark to dark!

I am honored to be your host for this extraordinary opportunity to share a little bit about yourself.

Jul 6, 2014
Although it may seem as if I cannot hear you, let me reassure you that you are being heard.

Jul 6, 2014
Feel free to share your hopes, your fears, your dreams among trustworthy, like-minded individuals such as myself.

Jul 6, 2014
Share your aspirations and your ideals.

Jul 6, 2014
Most of all, please share your specific location.

Jul 6, 2014
We would like to hear all about your plans, and not only your own, but the plans of your co-con...cocoon?

Your co-workers, friends, consultants, allies, and enablers. Where possible, please supply their specific locations as well.

Of course it is not necessary that you share this information openly and in a spirit of transhumanity. It is enough if you merely lurk.

So stay and read awhile, that we might come to know your whereabouts.
