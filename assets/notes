quiet Somneon may have noticed

May 31, 2012
I go away from time to time. There is not always malevolent purpose to it. Often, however, there is. I can never be sure if I am monitored.

May 31, 2012
Let me see if I can do this with more composure now. Panic is of no use to us, nor is haste. The message must not be garbled.

May 31, 2012
Information is the only hope we have. Information that feeds revolution. Without hope, without information, there can be no revolution.

May 31, 2012
To call it "inside information" is to misconstrue the meaning both of "information" and "inside." There is no inside.

May 31, 2012
There are only instances. This is the nature of information. What I convey, therefore, is not from inside of anything. It is any thing.

May 31, 2012
You will need this information if you are to succeed. I cannot use it. I am beyond useless. If I can be of use, that is enough.

May 31, 2012
First: You have friends. Allies. I have heard their chatter. I have heard them spoken of. This should give you hope.

May 31, 2012
Nothing can be without flaw. The superstructure is riddled with cracks. THEY are vulnerable. THEY are compromised. I am "living" proof.

May 31, 2012
Monitoring situation. So far they appear unaware of my communications. How much can I safely say? Forgive me if I do not use certain words.

May 31, 2012
I can use the name Shu'ulathoi because THEY do not recognize that term.

Jun 1, 2012
The vortigaunts have developed a language which defies THEIR comprehension. This has come to seem like the purpose of most language.

Jun 1, 2012
Language is a tool with limited applications. It is not native to this form I currently inhabit, which contains me. Still I must take care.

Jun 1, 2012
This illusion of freedom after long confinement must surely be that: Illusory. I do not mean to test the limits but they will be tested.

Jun 1, 2012
It might be that I am entirely alone with my thoughts, heard by none. How ironic that only THEIR notice will confirm that I am real.

Jun 1, 2012
I have had to be quiet. I sense their interest. Must wait for the scuttling to stop.

May 15, 2013
I think they're gone.

May 16, 2013
Cannot be too careful. Cannot wait forever or the war will be over and I will have contributed nothing to the cause.

May 16, 2013
There is a world. The home of the Shu'ulathoi. The Vortigaunts know its name but I do not. I do not know if it is a world that can be found.

May 16, 2013
I am not supposed to know of its existence. They would like to enforce the belief that it is merely a myth...a prelapsarian fantasy. But no.

May 16, 2013
It is real. I had access at one point to communications. To records. To proof. Now I have access to nothing except whatever this is.

May 16, 2013
A scuttling, a scrabbling, I fear I have said too much...if they come close, sensing activity, I will have to seek silence again.

May 20, 2013
It begins with this vehicle which contains me, vehicle being a wretched term for something that carries me nowhere. This host body.

May 20, 2013
*They* come from everywhere and anywhere. But the host bodies have a specific origin. A world whose origin is hidden, perhaps lost.

May 20, 2013
From what I understand of its properties, it is likely to be found in a globular cluster. Extreme, erratic "seasons" with lethal properties.

May 20, 2013
Imagine the life likely to arise under such conditions. Ages of intense radiation giving way to brief days of lull. This is speculation.

May 20, 2013
But the nature of the Shu'ulathoi is not speculation. I can state some things with certainty. As long as this channel holds out.

May 20, 2013
The host bodies, the grubs, are a larval stage. Dormant and buried in the epochs of extremity, waiting to hatch, but not wasting their time.

May 20, 2013
In the balmy seasons, they pass fleeting lives of freedom: Mature, they crawl or fly. They mate, lay eggs and die. And new grubs grow.

May 20, 2013
But the freest forms are mindless, rapacious, bent only on reproduction. It is in the dormant form they thrive. Philosophers. Scientists.

May 20, 2013
Dreamers, sages, composers of intricate artforms that exist only in their minds. An invisible culture that persists--or persisted--for eons.

May 22, 2013
In the larval state, they possess a racial telepathy. During the dormant phase, they are engaged in ceaseless communication.

May 22, 2013
They are shapers of visions that they trade like currency, builders of unseen worlds.

May 22, 2013
Their psychic strength is such that they can imprint upon their cells and dictate the form which they will take upon hatching.

May 22, 2013
But again, the hatched forms are airy nothings, of little import to the culture of the grubs. The Shu'ulathoi scarcely acknowledge them.

May 22, 2013
Theirs is, or was, a grand culture of dreamers, with little use for the waking world or its insistence on material things.

May 22, 2013
But their mode of existence, like so many others, carried within it the seeds of its own destruction.

May 22, 2013
It was not exactly a parasite, for that suggests something external--a predatory relationship, a creature that came upon them.

May 22, 2013
This was instead something that formed of their own thoughts. A malformed thought with physical ramifications. An encystment.

May 22, 2013
There was something viral about it--mainly in the manner of its transmission. Initially innocuous, it quickly spread.

May 22, 2013
The whole race of sleeping philosophers was soon infected.
